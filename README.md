## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and define the following:

env
- GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
- GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
- OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

## ⚙️ Configuration

LLM and provider configuration is managed via the following file:

config/config.yaml

The application supports multiple LLM providers. You can switch between them by specifying the model_provider parameter when initializing the agent workflow.

Example usage:

GraphBuilder(model_provider="groq")

or

GraphBuilder(model_provider="gemini")

This approach allows you to experiment with different LLM backends without modifying the core agent logic.
